# WIREFRAME

Wireframes are meant to be simple, to let you focus on the informational hierarchy, the content arrangement and user experience, before adding all the aesthetics.

This basic, drag and drop wireframing application has been created for non-designers who aren't familiar with generating wireframes for web applications. The Wireframe Application has a minimal interface, that encourages the use of a 12-column-grid design system that will help stylise the layout and rows for the spacing on the page.
